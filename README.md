## Project Support

### Code Contributions

Maintaining the integrity and consistency of the project is of the utmost importance. Therefore, contributions will strive and abide by these pull request and code changes guidelines as much as possible. Project code should have four (4) column tab indentations, should have braces on its own line by itself and aligned in the same column for use in control flow statements like if-else and functions to name a few, should not have any leading, except for tab indentations, or trailing white spaces, should have an empty line at the end of the file, and should be camelCase for variable names, camelCase for JavaScript method names, and CamelCase for C# class and method names. Project commits should use a maximum of fifty (50) characters for the commit title, should be in the present tense, should not end with punctuation, and should have the list of NuGet and LibMan library version differences and changes when applicable.

This project has a bug tracker that is used to keep track of issues with the program. It is recommended that issues should be reproduced at least two (2) times consistently and provide as much information as possible for contributors to replicate the issue. New issues should not be created if the same, or relatively similar, issue is still open and there has been activity within the past thirty (30) days or the current project release version is the same as the version indicated in the issue when it was originally created. This can be done on the [issues](https://github.com/chticer/fortunestreetanalyzer/issues) section of GitHub. A template for creating issues will be made in the future to help facilitate the use of submitting a new issue.

Project development will heavily rely and follow the comments and notes made by contributors in the latest Kanban board. This workflow will ensure on what features and changes will be made in the short-term and long-term and can be found on the [projects](https://github.com/chticer/fortunestreetanalyzer/projects) section of GitHub. Only a broad timeline will be given for a release, including a rough list of pull requests, issues, features, and changes, and can be seen in the [milestones](https://github.com/chticer/fortunestreetanalyzer/milestones) section of GitHub.

### Community Contributions

The owner heavily believes that the community should be able to weigh in and provide ways and opportunities for their voices to be heard. This helps strengthen relationships and improvements in both the program and all the people behind the project. Any form of legitimate and constructive suggestions, comments, requests, concerns, and criticisms regarding this project is greatly welcomed. This can be done in the [discussions](https://github.com/chticer/fortunestreetanalyzer/discussions) section of GitHub.

This project is currently being offered for free to anyone who wish to use the analyzer program. Also, all expenses incurred in running and maintaining the project is currently being paid by the owner. As project development is being done and when it is ready to be publicly available for the most part, costs will increase and project sponsorships may be necessary since the project is currently being hosted on the cloud with Microsoft Azure. When sponsorship is available, anyone can help support the project financially and will be recognized on GitHub and Patreon.
